# Library Book Sorting System

This repository contains two main files. The first is a C++ header file, which includes definitions and functions for nodes and an AVL self-balancing binary tree. These are specifically made for allowing a system which allows the user to use CRUD operations in reference to books, allowing creation, reading, updating, and deletion via title or author. The second file is a .cpp file which contains a menu that provide better readability and allows use of the system properly, as an example of how one would use this. It contains no book data by default, but the user can easily add it with the menu. 

## Prerequisites
